# Building a chrome extension
### This follows the [official chrome extension tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/). 

### Key takeaways
- every chrome extension needs a `manifest.json` file
- chrome provides APIs for accessing various functionalities like accessing tabs, storage, etc (and some really cool ones too). [Check here for a list of available APIs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/)
- most of these APIs require that you specify the permission to use them in the `manifest.json` file
